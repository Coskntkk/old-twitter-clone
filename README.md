## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned how important it is for the pages to be responsive.
I learned how high the probability of the user to encounter any errors and how critical it is to find and debug these errors.
It was hard, challenging for me to construct database system (it was my first time); but i have managed to overcome it with great effort.
I was unexperienced in techs like EJS, Express and Databases but it became was a great experience for me about theese and other techs.
